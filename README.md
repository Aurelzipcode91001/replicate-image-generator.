Automating Image Prompts

By default, this script does not generate prompts itself. You need to create prompts manually using a tool like ChatGPT before running the script. The workflow is as follows:

"A futuristic city skyline at sunset, cyberpunk aesthetic, neon lights, ultra-detailed."

Run the script with your prompt to generate AI images instantly.

Customizing the Prompt

Edit the input_data dictionary in generate_images.py to change the image generation prompt:

input_data = {
    "prompt": "A futuristic city skyline at sunset, cyberpunk aesthetic, neon lights, ultra-detailed",
}
